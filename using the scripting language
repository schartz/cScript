Solidus Code Script (.scs)

1) All input files to be loaded must have a file extension of scs.  Therefore, a file with the name "test.scs" is valid or anything
	with "*.scs"

2) Functions are the heart of the script.  They are to be called from your c++ application and/or from withing your script
	program.  
	
	(1) Layout of a function is as follows:
	
	function functionName(...args...){
	}
	
	(2) you can add arguments to your function by defintion by simply adding the name of the argument 
	without the var keyword
	
	example:
	
	function functionName( arg0, arg1,arg2){
	
	}
	
3) To declare variables, use use the var keyword
	example:
	
	function functionName( arg0, arg1, arg2){
		var x = 0
		x = (arg*2)^2
		
		print(x)
	}
4) System calls:
	print(value)	-prints value to console
	length()		-prints number of characters contained in a variable that contains a string using the
					dot operator
	example:
	function doFunc(){
		var s = "this is a string"
		
		print( s.length())	
		
	}
	
	the above script code prints the length of variable "s" to the console
